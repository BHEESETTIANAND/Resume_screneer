# Resume Screener üìÑüîç
Welcome to the Resume Screener project! This project aims to predict the role of a candidate based on their uploaded resume. It's built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

## How it Works
Upload Resume: Users can upload their resume in either .txt or .pdf format using the file uploader provided in the web application.

## Prediction: The uploaded resume is then processed using NLP techniques to extract relevant features. These features are used to make predictions about the role of the candidate.

## Display Prediction: The predicted role of the candidate is displayed to the user along with a confidence score. Additionally, the application provides a brief explanation of how the prediction was made.

## Technologies Used
### Streamlit: Used to build the web application interface.
### Scikit-learn: Utilized for training and deploying the machine learning model.
### NLTK: Used for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization and stopword removal.
### Joblib and Pickle: Used for serializing and deserializing the trained model and vectorizer.
### Git: Version control system used for managing project files.
